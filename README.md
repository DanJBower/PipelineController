# Pipeline controller

Pipeline controller provides a way to send Xbox Series X/S and PS5 controller signals to Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs, and PS5s

It allows automated plans to be created and executed on the target machine as if a real controller were playing the game

Created initially as a way to perform more complex grinding tasks within games

Disclaimer: You should **not** be using this to cheat in games and it is best **not** to use this in multiplayer if you don't want to get banned

This will for now be privately developed. If the code is made public, it may or may not be made open source. I'd like to find a license that basically says you can use this for whatever open-source(would it need a share-alike license like GPL?), research, education, internal use, or private personal use you'd like. However, you may not use anything substantial from this project for making any money, patents, etc...
